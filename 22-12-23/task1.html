            <li>Javascript is a high level programming language
            Javascript is intrepreted programming language which executes the code line by line
            Java script was invented by "brendan Eich in 1995"
            Java script was dovleped based on the reason of to alive the browsers
             intially the name of the java script is "MOCHA" then "LIVE SCRIPT" and now is "JAVA SCRIPT"
            java script engine which is used to what ever we can write in betwwen script tags that will compile and
                converted to machine code and make html elements communicate with the browser
            here some examples of javascript engines in differnt browsers

            <li>bigint value shoould be gretar than 2^53 value</li>
            <li>we can add value more than 16 digits by adding "n" alphabet at the value to be assigned this will use to aviod syntax error </li>
